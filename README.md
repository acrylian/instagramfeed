# instagramfeed
A [ZenphotoCMS](http://www.zenphoto.org) to display latest images from instragram.

It does not use the API and does not require any login or tokens.

## Installation

Place the file `instagramfeed.php` into your `/plugins` folder, enable it and set the plugin options. 

Add `instragramFeed::printFreed(4);` to your theme where you want to display it

Note the plugin does just print an unordered list with linked thumbs and does not provide any default CSS styling.
